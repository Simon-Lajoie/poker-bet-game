## Why Console-based game ?
The Console Application was chosen for this poker mini-game project as it was a great opportunity to learn the basics of C# programming and object-oriented design. While it may not be the most common choice for game development, using a console-based interface allows for a more focused experience on the core gameplay mechanics and logic. The project was completed as a way to learn more about C# and the .NET framework, specifically on how to work with console applications.
